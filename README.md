# Data Structure and Algorithms

All the theory was learned from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM&t=252s) course of freeCodeCamp Youtube Channel.

## Data Structure Implemented
- Dynamic Array: Structure in which can grow when trying to append more elements than the original can contain. Every time it happens, the array doubles in size.
- Double Linked List: Structure in which does not depend on contiguous memory space and is entirely based on Pointers.
- Queue: Structure in which can emulate a real-world queue.
- Tree: Structure in which each node can hold N references to another nodes. One reference points to the parent and the others points to its children. I'm implementing a Binary Search Tree.
