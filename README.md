# Data Structure and Algorithms

All the theory was learned from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM&t=252s) course of freeCodeCamp Youtube Channel.

## Data Structure Implemented
- Dynamic Array: An structure which can grow when trying to append more elements than the original can contain. Every time it happens, the array doubles in size.
- Double Linked List: An structure which does not depend on contiguous memory space and is entirely based on Pointers.

## Exercises
- Bracket exercise using Java Stack to learn more and play.
